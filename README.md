# Overview

This program was written with the intention of practicing the Java language by making a console game
that is capable of handling multiple aspects. This program is a battle tracker that allows the user to
take different actions, including varied results based on what the user has available. Actions range from
attacking to picking up a new item. Along with that, there is an inventory tracker that keeps track of the
player's items as well as an enemy that can change its tactics each turn. This program has been helpful in
learning the syntax of Java and seeing how it compares to other languages, like C++ or Python.

# Development Environment

This program was written and created on the Intellij IDE, a program that is made for both the
Java and the Kotlin languages. In particular, this was done using the Java programming language
using their utility library for items such as Random and Math.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Error Handling would be the biggest thing to add into this program. Right now, it doesn't have much,
  meaning if a user decided to input something random, the program would not be able to properly handle
  that as of right now.
- Some of the numbers may need to be observed in order to ensure a more balanced approach to the game.
  In some cases, it may feel like the user is not dealing enough damage or is taking too much damage.
  These are matters that will need to be observed and altered in order to provide a better user experience.
- A program like this has plenty of room to allow new features as well as updates to current features. A couple
  of examples can include more dynamics for the enemy or more status conditions.
